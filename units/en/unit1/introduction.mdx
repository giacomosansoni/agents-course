Welcome to the most exciting topics in AI: **Agentic AI**.

In this first unit, **you'll build a solid foundation in the fundamentals of AI Agents** including:

- **Understanding Agents**  
  - What is an Agent, and how does it work?  
  - How do Agents make decisions using reasoning and planning?

- **The Role of LLMs (Large Language Models) in Agents**  
  - How LLMs serve as the “brain” behind an Agent  
  - How LLMs structure conversations via the Messages system

- **Tools and Actions**  
  - How Agents use external tools to interact with the environment  
  - How to build and integrate tools for your Agent

- **The Agent Workflow:** *think* → *act* → *observe*


After exploring these topics, **you’ll build your first Agent from scratch**! 

Your Agent, named Alfred, will handle a simple task and demonstrate how to apply these concepts in practice. You’ll even learn how to **publish your Agent on Hugging Face Spaces**, so you can share it with friends and colleagues.

For instance, we created an Agent that selects mails that are interesting and deletes spam.

Finally, at the end of this Unit, you'll take a quiz. Pass it, and you'll **earn your first course certification**: the 🎓 Certificate of Fundamentals of Agents.
