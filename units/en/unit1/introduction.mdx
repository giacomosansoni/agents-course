Welcome to one of the most exciting topics in AI: **Agentic AI**.

In this first unit, you'll study the **fundamentals of AI Agents**:

- **What is an Agent** and how does it work?
- How do **Agents make decisions**?
- What role do **LLMs (Large Language Model) play in Agents**?
- How **Agents use tools to act**?
- How to **build tools for your Agent to use**?

Then, **you'll build your first Agent from scratch**! Your Agent, named Alfred, will be capable of completing a simple task. You'll also learn how to **publish your Agent on Hugging Face Spaces and share it with your friends**.

For instance, we created an Agent that selects mails that are interesting and deletes spam.

What we're going to do:
1. You're going to learn the big picture on what are Agents.

2. Then, we'll work on System Prompt, the part of the Agent we place the Tools it can use.

To understand this you'll need to:
1. Understand what LLMs are.
2. Understand how LLMs are structured into Chat Messages.
3. Now that you understand how ChatMessages works, How Tools are integrated into System Prompt.

3. Then, we'll study how the thought of process work so we'll:
- Dive deeper into the full Agent workflow (Observe, Think, Act)

It's a big Unit, we'll go step  by step, **so don't hesitate to take your time**.
