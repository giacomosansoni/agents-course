Welcome to one of the most exciting topics in AI: **Agentic AI**.

In this first unit, you'll study the fundamentals of AI Agents:

- **What is an Agent** and how does it work?
- How do **Agents make decisions**?
- What role do **LLMs (Large Language Model) play in AI Agents**?
- How **Agents use tools to act**?
- How to **build tools for your Agent to use**?

Then, **you'll build your first AI Agent from scratch**! Your Agent, named Alfred, will be capable of completing a simple task. You'll also learn how to **publish your Agent on Hugging Face Spaces and share it with your friends**.

For instance, we created an Agent that selects mails that are interesting and deletes spam.
