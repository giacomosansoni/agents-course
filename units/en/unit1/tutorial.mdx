# Let's Create Our First Agent Using Smolagents

In the last section, we learned how we can create Agents from scratch using Python code, and we **saw just how tedious that process can be**. Fortunately, many Agent libraries simplify this work by handling much of the heavy lifting for you.

In this tutorial, you'll create your very first Agent—capable of performing JOFFREY—and publish it on Hugging Face Spaces so you can share it with friends and colleagues.

Let's get started!


## What is smolagents?

To make this Agent, we're going to use a library called `smolagents`, a library that **provides a framework for developing your agents with ease**.

This lightweight library abstracts away much of the complexity of building an Agent we saw in the last section, allowing you to focus on designing your agent's behavior

We're going to get deeper into SmolAgents in the next Unit, but if you're interested you can check this [blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents).

Congratulations, you've built your first Agent! Don't hesitate to share it with your friends and colleagues.

Since this is your first try, it's perfectly normal if it's a little buggy or slow. In future units, we'll learn how to build even better Agents.

The best way to learn is to try, so don't hesitate to update it, add more tools, try with another model etc.

In the next section, you're going to fill the final Quiz and get your certificate!
