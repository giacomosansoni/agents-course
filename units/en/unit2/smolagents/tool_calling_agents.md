# Tool Calling Agents  

Tool Calling Agents are the second type of agent available in `smolagents`. They utilize built-in tool-calling methods and generate tool calls in JSON format. While `smolagents` primarily focuses on `CodeAgents` and recommends using them,  `ToolCallingAgents` are an extra feature for JSON specific tasks.

## How Do Tool Calling Agents Work?  

This agent type follows the same multi-step workflow as `CodeAgent`. If you have any doubts, refer to the [previous section](./code_agents.md). Just like `CodeAgents`, the LLM generates and executes actions, often involving external tool calls. However, in this case, the actions are structured as JSON objects, specifying tool names and arguments as text. The system then parses these instructions to determine which tool to execute.  

## Example: Running a Tool Calling Agent  

To illustrate, let's run the same search example from the previous section, but this time using `ToolCallingAgent`. This allows us to compare their differences. Notice that we only change the agent type, while the framework handles the rest automatically:  

```python
from smolagents import ToolCallingAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel

agent = ToolCallingAgent(tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()], model=HfApiModel())

agent.run("How many seconds would it take for a leopard at full speed to run through Pont des Arts?")
```

If you check the trace generated by the agent, you won't see the `Executing parsed code:` output. Instead, you'll see something like:  

`Calling tool: 'web_search' with arguments: {'query': 'leopard full speed and Pont des Arts length'}`  

Here, the agent generates a structured tool call that needs to be processed to produce the actual output, rather than directly generating and executing code as in `CodeAgent`.
