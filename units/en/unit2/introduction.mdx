# Frameworks

Now, we've mastered our fundamental understanding of agents, we can dive into the most popular frameworks that are used to build them!

In this second unit, **You will learn how to build agents and agentic workflows with various frameworks** including:

**[smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)**: a barebones library for agents. Agents write python code to call tools and orchestrate other agents.

**[LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)**: a data framework for your LLM application. Building with LlamaIndex typically involves working with LlamaIndex core and a chosen set of integrations (or plugins).

**[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)**: a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, used to create agent and multi-agent workflows.

Sounds more or less similar, right?

Don't worry. After this unit, you will have a solid understanding of each one of these frameworks and **how and when to use each framework**. You will also have **hands-on experience with building agents** using each framework.

You will create an agent called Alfred, which can help you with tasks like Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG).
Not only focussing on a single vector database, but also offering Alfred the tools to do query rewriting, web search, and everything else you need to build an optimal RAG system.
