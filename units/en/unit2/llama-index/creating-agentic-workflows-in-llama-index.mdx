# Creating agentic workflows in LlamaIndex

A Workflow in LlamaIndex is an event-driven abstraction used to chain together several events. Workflows are made up of steps, with each step responsible for handling certain event types and emitting new events.

Workflows in LlamaIndex work by decorating function with a `@step` decorator. This is used to infer the input and output types of each workflow for validation, and ensures each step only runs when an accepted event is ready.

Workflows are defined by the `Workflow` class, which takes a list of steps and an optional name and description.
