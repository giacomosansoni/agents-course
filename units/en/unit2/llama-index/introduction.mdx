# Frameworks: LlamaIndex

LlamaIndex is a data framework for your LLM application. Building with LlamaIndex typically involves working with LlamaIndex core and a chosen set of integrations (or plugins).

In this framework section, we will learn what LlamaIndex is, how it works, and how it is different from other frameworks. We will do so by going over it's main concepts including:

- **Components**: Components are the building blocks of workflows. They are any `llama-index` components that are integrated into the framework.
- **Tools**: Tools are components that provide specific capabilities like searching, calculating, or accessing external services. They are the building blocks that enable agents to perform tasks.
- **Agents**: Agents are autonomous components that can use tools and make decisions. They coordinate tool usage to accomplish complex goals.
- **Workflows**: A workflow is a sequence of steps, events made of components that are executed in order.

All of these concepts are required in different scenarios to create genuinly useful agents.
In the following sections, we will go over each of these concepts in detail.
After mastering the concepts, we will use our learnings to **create applied usecases with Alfred the agent**!

Getting our hands on LlamaIndex is exciting, right? So, what are we waiting for? Let's get started! ðŸš€
