# Frameworks: LlamaIndex

LlamaIndex is a data framework for your LLM application. Building with LlamaIndex typically involves working with LlamaIndex core and a chosen set of integrations (or plugins).

In this framework section, we will learn what LlamaIndex is, how it works, and how it is different from other frameworks. We will do so by going over it's main concepts including:

**LlamaParse**: a tool for parsing and extracting information from text.

**Components**: Components are the building blocks of workflows. They are any `llama-index` components that are integrated into the framework.

**Workflows**: A workflow is a sequence of steps, events made of components that are executed in order. |

All of these concepts are required in different scenarios to create genuinly useful agents. In the following sections, we will go over each of these concepts in detail.

After mastering the general concepts, we will use our learnings to **create Alfred the agentic RAG Agent**!

Agentic RAG with LlamaIndex is exciting, right? So, what are we waiting for? Let's get started! ðŸš€
