# Building Blocks of LangGraph

To build agents with LangGraph, you need to understand its core components. Let's explore the fundamental building blocks that make up a LangGraph application.

An application in LangGraph starts from an **entrypoint** and depending on the execution happening the flow may go to a function or another untill it reach the END.

## 1. State

**State** is the central concept in LangGraph. It represents all the information that flows through your agent application. 

```python
from typing import TypedDict, List, Dict, Any

# Define your state schema
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    current_step: str
```

The state is **User defined**, hence the fields should carefully be crafter to contain all data needed for decision-making process!

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Think carefully about what information your agent needs to track between steps.

## 2. Nodes

**Nodes** are python functions. Each node:
- Takes the state as input
- Performs some operation
- Returns updates to the state

```python
# Simple node function
def retrieve_documents(state: AgentState):
    query = state["messages"][-1]["content"]
    # Logic to retrieve documents
    return {"documents": retrieved_docs}

# Add to graph
graph.add_node("retrieve", retrieve_documents)
```

For example Nodes can contain:
- **LLM calls**: Generate text or make decisions
- **Tool calls**: Interact with external systems
- **Conditional logic**: Determine next steps
- **Human intervention**: Get input from users

> ðŸ’¡ **Info:** Some nodes necessary for the whole workflow like START and END exist from langGraph directly. 


## 3. Edges

**Edges** connect nodes and define the possible paths through your graph:

```python
# Simple linear connection
graph.add_edge("retrieve", "generate_answer")

# Conditional branching
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "analyze_question",
    decide_next_step,  # Function that returns the next node name
    {
        "need_search": "search_web",
        "need_calculation": "calculator",
        "ready_to_answer": "generate_answer"
    }
)
```

Edges can be:
- **Direct**: Always go from node A to node B
- **Conditional**: Choose the next node based on the current state

## 4. StateGraph

The **StateGraph** is the container that holds your entire agent workflow:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

# Create a graph with your state type
graph = StateGraph(AgentState)
```

## What's Next?

In the next section, we'll put these concepts into practice by building our first graph. This graph lets Alphred take in your e-mail, classify them and craft a preliminary answer if they are genuine.
