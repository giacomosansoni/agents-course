Welcome to this next part of our journey, where you'll learn **how to build applications** using the [`LangGraph`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) framework designed to help you structure and orchestrate complex LLM workflows.

`LangGraph` is a framework that allows you to build **production-ready** applications by giving you **control** tools over the flow of your agent.

## Module Overview

In this unit, you’ll discover:

### 1️⃣ [What is LangGraph, and when to use it?](./when_to_use_langgraph)
### 2️⃣ [Building Blocks of LangGraph](./building_blocks)
### 3️⃣ [Alfred, the mail sorting butler](./first_graph)
### 4️⃣ [Quiz](./quizz1)

By the end of this unit, you’ll be equipped to build robust, organized and production ready applications ! 

That being said, this section is an introduction to langGraph and more advances topics can be discovered in the free langChain academy course : [Introduction to LangGraph](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph)
