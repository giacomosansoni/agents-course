This guide is designed to help you get started with Discord, a free chat platform popular in the gaming and ML communities.

Join the Hugging Face Community Discord server, which has over 100,000 members, by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/UrrTSsSyjb). It's a great place to connect with others!

Starting on Discord can be a bit overwhelming, so here's a quick guide to help you navigate.

When you [sign up for our Discord server](http://hf.co/join/discord), you'll be prompted to choose your interests. Be sure to select **"AI Agents"** to gain access to the AI Agents Category, which includes all the course-related channels. Feel free to explore and join additional channels if you wish! üöÄ

The HF Community Server hosts a vibrant community with interests in various areas, offering opportunities for learning through paper discussions, events, and more.

After signing up, introduce yourself in the `#introduce-yourself` channel.

We created 4 channels for the Agents Course:

- ‚Å†`agents-course-announcements` : for the **latest course informations**.
- `üéì-agents-course-general` : for **general discussions and chitcha**t.
‚Å†- `agents-course-questions` : to **ask questions and help your classmates**.
‚Å†- `agents-course-showcase` :‚Å† to **show your best agents** .

In addition you can check:

- `smolagents`: for **discussion and support with the library**.

Here are a few tips for using Discord effectively:

- **Voice channels** are available, though text chat is more commonly used.
- You can format text using **markdown style**, which is especially useful for writing code. Note that markdown doesn't work as well for links.
- Consider opening threads for **long conversations** to keep discussions organized.

We hope you find this guide helpful! If you have any questions, feel free to ask us on Discord ü§ó.
