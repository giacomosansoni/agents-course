# And now? What topics I should learn?

Agentic AI is a rapidly evolving field, and understanding foundational protocols is essential for building intelligent, autonomous systems. 

Two important protocols to familiarize yourself with are the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol.

### üîå Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic is an open standard that enables AI models to securely and seamlessly **connect with external tools, data sources, and applications, facilitating more capable and autonomous AI agents**.

Think of MCP as a **universal adapter‚Äîsimilar to a USB-C port** that allows AI systems to interact with various software and data environments without the need for custom integrations.

MCP is gaining adoption across the AI ecosystem, with major companies like OpenAI and Google integrating it into their platforms. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Context_Protocol?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### ü§ù Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol

Google has developed the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol** as a complementary counterpart to Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP). While MCP focuses on connecting AI models to external tools and data sources, A2A is designed to facilitate seamless communication and collaboration between AI agents themselves.
