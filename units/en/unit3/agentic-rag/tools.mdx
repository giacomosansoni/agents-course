# Giving your agents access to the web

In this unit, we'll be giving Alfred access to the web to help him find the latest news and information about the world.

## Give your agent access to the web

Remember that we want Alfred to establish his presence as true renaissance host, with a deep knowledge of the world.

To do so, we need to make sure that Alfred has access to the latest news and information about the world.

Let's start by creating a web search tool for Alfred!

```python

## Creating a Custom Tool for Weather Information to Schedule the Fireworks

Remember that we need to make sure the fireworks are not cancelled due to bad weather?

As before, we can use a `ToolSpec` to create a tool for Alfred.
When searching for `"weather"` in LlamaHub, we get a list of `ToolSpecs` that are relevant to weather.
However, the tools that are available in the LlamaHub are not always what we need.
Both returned tools require authentication with an API key, which is not what we want so we will create a custom tool.

Let's create a custom tool that can be used to call an external weather API and get the weather information for a given location.

```python

```
