# Building and Integrating Tools for Your Agent

In this section, we'll be giving Alfred access to the web to help him find the latest news and information about the world. 
Additionally. we will give Alfred acess to weather details and models downloads statistics.

## Give Your Agent Access to the Web

Remember that we want Alfred to establish his presence as a true renaissance host, with a deep knowledge of the world.

To do so, we need to make sure that Alfred has access to the latest news and information about the world.

Let's start by creating a web search tool for Alfred!

<hfoptions id="agents-frameworks">
<hfoption id="smolagents">

```python
from smolagents import DuckDuckGoSearchTool

# Initialize the DuckDuckGo search tool
search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchTool()

# Example usage
results = search_tool("Who's the current President of France?")
print(results)
```

Expected output:

```python
The current President of France in Emmanuel Macron.
```


</hfoption>
<hfoption id="llama-index">

```python
from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool
from duckduckgo_search import DDGS

def get_search_info(query: str, max_results: int = 10) -> str:
    ddgs = DDGS()
    results = ddgs.text(query, max_results=max_results)
    if len(results) == 0:
        raise Exception("No results found! Try a less restrictive/shorter query.")
    postprocessed_results = [f"[{result['title']}]({result['href']})\n{result['body']}" for result in results]
    return "## Search Results\n\n" + "\n\n".join(postprocessed_results)

# Initialize the DuckDuckGo search tool
search_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(get_search_info)
# Example usage
print(search_tool("Who's the current President of France?"))
```

Expected output:

```python
The current President of France in Emmanuel Macron.
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="langgraph">

```python
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchRun

search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchRun()
results = search_tool.invoke("Who's the current President of France?")
print(results)
```

Expected output:

```python
The current President of France in Emmanuel Macron.
```

## Creating a Custom Tool for Weather Information to Schedule the Fireworks

Remember that we need to make sure the fireworks are not cancelled due to bad weather?

Let's create a custom tool that can be used to call an external weather API and get the weather information for a given location.

<Tip>
For the sake of simplicity, we're using a dummy weather API for this example. If you want to use a real weather API, you could implement a weather tool that uses the OpenWeatherMap API, like in [Unit 1](../unit1/tutorial.mdx).
</Tip>

<hfoptions id="agents-frameworks">
<hfoption id="smolagents">

```python
from smolagents import Tool
import random

class WeatherInfoTool(Tool):
    name = "weather_info"
    description = "Fetches dummy weather information for a given location."
    inputs = {
        "location": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The location to get weather information for."
        }
    }
    output_type = "string"

    def forward(self, location: str):
        # Dummy weather data
        weather_conditions = [
            {"condition": "Rainy", "temp_c": 15},
            {"condition": "Clear", "temp_c": 25},
            {"condition": "Windy", "temp_c": 20}
        ]
        # Randomly select a weather condition
        data = random.choice(weather_conditions)
        return f"Weather in {location}: {data['condition']}, {data['temp_c']}Â°C"

## Creating a Hub Stats Tool for Influential AI Builders

Alfred can impress influential AI builders by discussing their most popular models. We'll create a tool to fetch model statistics from the Hugging Face Hub based on a username.

<hfoptions id="agents-frameworks">
<hfoption id="smolagents">

```python
from smolagents import Tool
from huggingface_hub import list_models

class HubStatsTool(Tool):
    name = "hub_stats"
    description = "Fetches the most downloaded model from a specific author on the Hugging Face Hub."
    inputs = {
        "author": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The username of the model author/organization to find models from."
        }
    }
    output_type = "string"

    def forward(self, author: str):
        try:
            # List models from the specified author, sorted by downloads
            models = list(list_models(author=author, sort="downloads", direction=-1, limit=1))
            
            if models:
                model = models[0]
                return f"The most downloaded model by {author} is {model.id} with {model.downloads:,} downloads."
            else:
                return f"No models found for author {author}."
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error fetching models for {author}: {str(e)}"

# Initialize the tool
hub_stats_tool = HubStatsTool()

# Example usage
print(hub_stats_tool("facebook")) # Example: Get the most downloaded model by Facebook
```

Expected output:

```Python
The most downloaded model by facebook is facebook/esmfold_v1 with 12,544,550 downloads.
```

```

Expected output:

```python
The most downloaded model by facebook is facebook/esmfold_v1 with 13,109,861 downloads.
```

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

With the Hub Stats Tool, Alfred can now impress influential AI builders by discussing their most popular models.

## Integrating Tools with Alfred

Now that we have all the tools, let's integrate them into Alfred's agent:

<hfoptions id="agents-frameworks">
<hfoption id="smolagents">

```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent, HfApiModel

# Initialize the Hugging Face model
model = HfApiModel()

# Create Alfred with all the tools
alfred = CodeAgent(
    tools=[search_tool, weather_info_tool, hub_stats_tool], 
    model=model
)

# Example query Alfred might receive during the gala
response = alfred.run("Who is Meta AI and what's their most popular model?")

print("ðŸŽ© Alfred's Response:")
print(response)
```

Expected output: 

```python
ðŸŽ© Alfred's Response:
Meta or previously facebook is an American multinational technology conglomerate.
The most downloaded model by facebook is facebook/esmfold_v1 with 12.195.721 downloads.
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="llama-index">

```python
from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import AgentWorkflow
from llama_index.llms.huggingface_api import HuggingFaceInferenceAPI

# Initialize the Hugging Face model
llm = HuggingFaceInferenceAPI(model_name="Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct")
# Create Alfred with all the tools
alfred = AgentWorkflow.from_tools_or_functions(
    [search_tool, weather_info_tool, hub_stats_tool],
    llm=llm
)

# Example query Alfred might receive during the gala
response = await alfred.run("Who is Meta AI and what's their most popular model?")

print("ðŸŽ© Alfred's Response:")
print(response)
```

Expected output: 

```python
ðŸŽ© Alfred's Response:
Meta AI, formerly known as Facebook AI, is a research lab focused on advancing and applying artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. Their most popular model on the Hugging Face Hub is `facebook/esmfold_v1`, which has been downloaded 12,544,550 times.

## Conclusion

By integrating these tools, Alfred is now equipped to handle a variety of tasks, from web searches to weather updates and model statistics. This ensures he remains the most informed and engaging host at the gala.

<Exercise>
Try implementing a tool that can be used to get the latest news about a specific topic.

When you're done, implement your custom tools in the `tools.py` file.
