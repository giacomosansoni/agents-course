# Giving your agents access to the web

In this unit, we'll be giving Alfred access to the web to help him find the latest news and information about the world.

## Give your agent access to the web

Remember that we want Alfred to establish his presence as a true renaissance host, with a deep knowledge of the world.

To do so, we need to make sure that Alfred has access to the latest news and information about the world.

Let's start by creating a web search tool for Alfred!

```python
from smolagents import DuckDuckGoSearchTool

# Initialize the DuckDuckGo search tool
search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchTool()

# Example usage
results = search_tool("Who's the current president of France?")
print(results)
```

## Creating a Custom Tool for Weather Information to Schedule the Fireworks

Remember that we need to make sure the fireworks are not cancelled due to bad weather?

Let's create a custom tool that can be used to call an external weather API and get the weather information for a given location.

<Tip>
For the sake of simplicity, we're using a dummy weather API for this example. If you want to use a real weather API, you could implement a weather tool that uses the OpenWeatherMap API, like in [Unit 1](../unit1/tutorial.mdx).
</Tip>

```python
from smolagents import Tool
import random

class WeatherInfoTool(Tool):
    name = "weather_info"
    description = "Fetches dummy weather information for a given location."
    inputs = {
        "location": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The location to get weather information for."
        }
    }
    output_type = "string"

    def forward(self, location: str):
        # Dummy weather data
        weather_conditions = [
            {"condition": "Rainy", "temp_c": 15},
            {"condition": "Clear", "temp_c": 25},
            {"condition": "Windy", "temp_c": 20}
        ]
        # Randomly select a weather condition
        data = random.choice(weather_conditions)
        return f"Weather in {location}: {data['condition']}, {data['temp_c']}Â°C"

# Initialize the tool
weather_info_tool = WeatherInfoTool()
```

## Creating a Hub Stats Tool for Influential AI Builders

Alfred can impress influential AI builders by discussing their most popular models. We'll create a tool to fetch model statistics from the Hugging Face Hub based on a username.

```python
from smolagents import Tool
from huggingface_hub import list_models

class HubStatsTool(Tool):
    name = "hub_stats"
    description = "Fetches the most downloaded model from a specific author on the Hugging Face Hub."
    inputs = {
        "author": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The username of the model author/organization to find models from."
        }
    }
    output_type = "string"

    def forward(self, author: str):
        try:
            # List models from the specified author, sorted by downloads
            models = list(list_models(author=author, sort="downloads", direction=-1, limit=1))
            
            if models:
                model = models[0]
                return f"The most downloaded model by {author} is {model.id} with {model.downloads:,} downloads."
            else:
                return f"No models found for author {author}."
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error fetching models for {author}: {str(e)}"

# Initialize the tool
hub_stats_tool = HubStatsTool()

# Example usage
print(hub_stats_tool("facebook"))  # Example: Get the most downloaded model by Facebook
```

With the Hub Stats Tool, Alfred can now impress influential AI builders by discussing their most popular models.

## Integrating Tools with Alfred

Now that we have all the tools, let's integrate them into Alfred's agent:

```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent, HfApiModel

# Initialize the Hugging Face model
model = HfApiModel()

# Create Alfred with all the tools
alfred = CodeAgent(
    tools=[search_tool, weather_info_tool, hub_stats_tool], 
    model=model
)

# Example query Alfred might receive during the gala
response = alfred.run("Who is Meta AI and what's their most popular model?")

print("ðŸŽ© Alfred's Response:")
print(response)
```

## Conclusion

By integrating these tools, Alfred is now equipped to handle a variety of tasks, from web searches to weather updates and model statistics. This ensures he remains the most informed and engaging host at the gala.

<Exercise>
Try implementing a tool that can be used to get the latest news about a specific topic.

When you're done, implement your tool in the `tools.py` file.
