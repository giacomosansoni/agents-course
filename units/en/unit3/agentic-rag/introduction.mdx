# Introduction to Use Case for Agentic RAG

In this unit, we will help Alfred, our friendly agent who is hosting the gala, by using Agentic RAG to create a tool that can be used to answer questions about the guests at the gala. 

This is a 'real-world' use case for Agentic RAG, that you could use in your own projects or workplaces.

Of course, we will frame our project around Alfred, our friendly agent who is hosting the gala. However, you can apply the same workflow to any of your agentic RAG problems!

You can choose any of the frameworks discussed in the course for this use case. We provide code samples for each in separate tabs.
