# Introduction to Use Case for Agentic RAG

In this unit, we will help Alfred, our friendly agent who is hosting the gala, by using Agentic RAG to create a tool that can be used to answer questions about the guests at the gala. 

<Tip>
This is a 'real-world' use case for Agentic RAG, that you could use in your own projects or workplaces. If you want to get more out of this project, why not try it out on your own use case and share in Discord?

You can choose any of the frameworks discussed in the course for this use case. We provide code samples for each in separate tabs.
