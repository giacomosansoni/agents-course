# Conclusion

In this unit, we've learned how to create an agentic RAG system to help Alfred, our friendly neighborhood agent, prepare for and manage an extravagant gala.

We've covered:
- Setting up the gala scenario and requirements
- Understanding Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Creating a database for guest information
- Building a custom weather tool for scheduling fireworks
- Implementing web search capabilities for real-time information
- Adding memory to our agent for better conversation flow
- Testing our agent in various scenarios

With these tools and capabilities, Alfred is now well-equipped to be the perfect host, able to answer questions about guests, provide up-to-date information, and ensure the gala runs smoothly - even managing the perfect timing for the fireworks display!

The combination of RAG with agentic capabilities demonstrates how powerful AI assistants can become when they have access to both structured knowledge and the ability to take actions based on that knowledge.

In the next unit, we'll explore more advanced agent capabilities and continue building on what we've learned.
