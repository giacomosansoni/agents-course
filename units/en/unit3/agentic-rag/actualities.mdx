# Importing a Tool from the LlamaHub to Websearch Actualities

Remember that we want Alfred to establish his presence as true renaissance host, with a deep knowledge of the world.

To do so, we need to make sure that Alfred has access to the latest news and information about the world.

Let's start by creating a web search tool for Alfred!

## Websearch using DuckDuckGoSearchToolSpec

Remember the [`ToolSpecs`](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/deploying/agents/tools/#tool-specs) from the previous unit?
We can use them to create a web search tool for Alfred.
Generally, when working with web search, DuckDuckGo is a good choice, as it is a search engine that is open to all and does not require any authentication.
To create a web search tool for Alfred, we can use the [`DuckDuckGoSearchToolSpec`](https://llamahub.ai/l/tools/llama-index-tools-duckduckgo?from=).

Let's create the tool spec for the web search tool.

```python
from llama_index.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoSearchToolSpec
from llama_index.agent.openai import OpenAIAgent

tool_spec = DuckDuckGoSearchToolSpec()

agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(DuckDuckGoSearchToolSpec.to_tool_list())

agent.chat("What are the latest developments in machine learning?")
agent.chat("What does the word 'renaissance' mean?")
```

We can see that the agent is able to use the tool to search the web for information.

Great, let's continue with a a tool that can help Alfred get the weather information!
