# A Gala to Remember

And then, it was time to get our hands dirty with an actual use case. Let's set the stage!

**You decided to host the most extravagant and opulent party of the century.** This means, lavish feasts, enchanting dancers, renowned DJs, exquisite drinks, a breathtaking fireworks display and much more.

Alfred, your friendly neighborhood agent, is getting ready to watch over your all of the needs for this party and **Alfred is going to manage everything himself**. In order to do so, he needs to have access to all of the information about the party, including the menu, the guests, the schedule, weather forecasts and much more!

Not only that, but he also needs to make sure that the party is going to be a success, so **he needs to be able to answer any questions about the party during the party**, while also being able to handle any unexpected situations that may arise.

He can't do this alone, so we need to make sure that Alfred has access to all of the information and tools he needs.

First, let's give him a list of hard requirements for the gala.

## The gala requirements

A properly educated person in the age of the **renaissance** needs to have three main traits.
He or she needed to profound in the **knowledge of sports, culture, and science**. So, we need to make sure we can impress our guests with our knowledge and provide them with a gala that is truly unforgettable.

According to etiquette, a good host also needs to be aware of all actualities in the news, as well as the information of any guests that might show up at a hosted party, including their allergies, and preferences.
To avoid any confliect, there are some things that are just not acceptable at a gala because we want it to be an inclusive and open party, such as **politics** and **religion**.

Lastly, we need to make sure that we've got some general knowledge about the weather to ensure we can continuously find a real-time update to ensure perfect timing to launch the fireworks and end the gala with a bang! ðŸŽ†

As you can see, Alfred needs a lot of information to be able to host the gala.
Luckily, we can help and prepare Alfred by giving him some Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) training!
