# Conclusion [[conclusion]]

Congratulations on finishing this first Bonus Unit ðŸ¥³

You've just **mastered what is Function-Calling and how to fine-tune your model to do Function-Calling**!

If we have one advice now, is try to **fine-tune different models**. The **best way to learn is by trying.**

In the next Unit, you're going to learn how to use **state-of-the-art frameworks such as `smolagents`, `langchain` and `llama-index`**.

Finally, we would love **to hear what you think of the course and how we can improve it**. If you have some feedback then, please ðŸ‘‰ [fill this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9VaONn0eglax0uTwi29rIn4tM7H2sYmmybmG5jJNlE5v0xA/viewform?usp=dialog)
