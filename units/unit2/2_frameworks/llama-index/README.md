# Llama Index

## What is the framework?

LlamaIndex is the leading framework for building LLM-powered agents on your data by creating `workflows`, using any integrated `components` available in `llama-index`. You can then build, iterate and deploy these agents in multi-agent systems using `LlamaDeploy`.

### What are components?

Components are the building blocks of workflows. They are any `llama-index` components that are integrated into the framework.

### What are workflows?

Workflows are multi-step processes that combine one or more agents, data connectors, and other tools to complete a task. They are event-driven software that allows you to combine RAG data sources and multiple agents to create a complex application that can perform a wide variety of tasks with reflection, error-correction, and other hallmarks of advanced LLM applications. You can then deploy these agentic workflows as production microservices.

### What is LlamaDeploy?

LlamaDeploy is an async-first framework for deploying, scaling, and productionizing agentic multi-service systems based on agents and workflows from `llama_index`.

## Why should you use this framework for agents over others?

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Workflow | A workflow is a sequence of steps that are executed in order. |
| Service | A service is a function that is executed by the agent. |
| Agent | An agent is a collection of services that are executed by the agent. |
