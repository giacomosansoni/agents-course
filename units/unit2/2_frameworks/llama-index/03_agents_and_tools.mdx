# Understanding Data Agents in LlamaIndex

Let's recap the definition of an Agent:

> An Agent is a system that leverages an AI model to interact with its environment in order to achieve a user-defined objective. It combines reasoning, planning, and the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfill tasks.

Within LlamaIndex, we build data agents with two core components:

1. A reasoning loop, discussed in [unit 1 on internal reasoning]
2. A set of tools, discussed in [unit 1 on tools]

### The Reasoning Loop

LlamaIndex supports three main types of reasoning agents:

1. Function Calling Agents - These work with AI models that can call specific functions
2. ReAct Agents - These can work with any AI that does chat or text
3. Advanced Agents - These use more complex methods like LLMCompiler or Chain-of-Abstraction

### The tools

Tools are like the different abilities a Data Agent has. They're basically APIs that the agent can use to:
- Get information
- Change data
- Interact with other systems

## How to Create a Basic Data Agent

Here's a simple example using OpenAI's system:

```python
from llama_index.agent.openai import OpenAIAgent
from llama_index.llms.huggingface_api import HuggingFaceInferenceAPILM

# Set up the AI model
llm = HuggingFaceInferenceAPILM(model_name="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct")

# Create the agent with your chosen tools
agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(tools, llm=llm, verbose=True)
```

You can use this agent in two ways:
1. Let it complete tasks automatically from start to finish
2. Control it step-by-step for more precise oversight

This setup gives you a powerful tool that can understand, process, and work with your data intelligently.
