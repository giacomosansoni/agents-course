# What is LlamaIndex?

LlamaIndex is **a complete toolkit for working with LLMs**. For this course we'll focus on three main parts that help build agents in LlamaIndex: **LlamaParse**, **Components** and **Workflows**.

Let's look at each of these key parts of LlamaIndex and how they help with agents:

**LlamaParse** is a tool that reads documents and prepares them for LLMs to use (like in RAG or with agents). It can:
- Read data from many different types of files and sources
- Turn documents into formats that LLMs can easily understand
- Work smoothly with other LlamaIndex tools

**Components** are the basic building blocks you use in LlamaIndex. These include things like prompts, models, agents and databases. Components often help connect LlamaIndex with other tools and libraries.

**Workflows** are step-by-step processes that join components together. They:
- React to events and triggers
- Can use RAG data sources
- Can check their work and fix mistakes
- Can run as small services in production

Now, let's see how these parts work together to help build agents and tools in LlamaIndex.

## Agents and tools in LlamaIndex

Now that we know the main parts of LlamaIndex, let's see how they help with agents and tools.

`LlamaParse` helps agents and tools read and understand different types of data.
`Components` are like tools that agents use to interact with things in the world.
And `Workflows` give agents a clear path to follow when making decisions.

Let's see how our friend Alfred would work in LlamaIndex:

## What Makes LlamaIndex Special?

While LlamaIndex does some things similar to other frameworks like smolagents, it has some key benefits:

1. **Built-in Document Reading with LlamaParse** LlamaParse was made specifically for LlamaIndex, so it works better than document readers in other frameworks

2. **Many Ready-to-Use Components** LlamaIndex has been around for a while, so it works with lots of other tools and frameworks. This means it has many tested and reliable components

3. **Clear Workflow System**. Workflows help break down how agents should make decisions step by step. This is like having a map for a conversation or task.

We'll look more closely at each of these parts and how they work together in the next sections. Let's start with `LlamaParse`.
