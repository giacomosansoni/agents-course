# What is Llama Index?

This module covers how to build effective agents using the [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/) framework.

## What is the framework?

LlamaIndex is the leading framework for building LLM-powered agents on your data by creating `workflows`, using any integrated `components` available in `llama-index`. You can then build, iterate and deploy these agents in multi-agent systems using `LlamaDeploy`.

### [What is LlamaParse?](./llamadeploy.md)

LlamaParse is a GenAI-native document parser that can parse complex document data for any downstream LLM use case (RAG, agents).

### [What are components?](./components.md)

Components are the building blocks of workflows. They are any `llama-index` components that are integrated into the framework.

### [What are workflows?](./workflows.md)

Workflows are multi-step processes that combine one or more agents, data connectors, and other tools to complete a task. They are event-driven software that allows you to combine RAG data sources and multiple agents to create a complex application that can perform a wide variety of tasks with reflection, error-correction, and other hallmarks of advanced LLM applications. You can then deploy these agentic workflows as production microservices.

## Why should you use this framework for agents over others?

All frameworks are equal, but some are more equal than others. T

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [Components](./components.md) | A component is a building block of a workflow, like an agent, a model, a prompt, or a tool. |
| [Workflows](./workflows.md) | A workflow is a sequence of steps, events made of components that are executed in order. |

## [Integrations](./components.md)

We have already mentioned that `llama-index` is a framework that relies on components to create agentic AI. These components also consist of LLM, embeddings, tool and AI integrations.
