## What does the course look like? [[course-look-like]]

The course is composed of:

- *A fundamental part*: where you learn a **concept in theory**.
- *A hands-on*: where you'll learn **to use established AI Agent libraries** to train your agents in unique environments. These hands-on will be **Hugging Face spaces** with a pre-configured environment!
- *Use case assignments*: where you'll apply the concepts you've learned to solve a real-world problem.
- *The Challenge*: you'll get to put your agent to compete against other agents in a challenge. There will also be [a leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/AI-Agents-Leaderboard) for you to compare the agents' performance.
