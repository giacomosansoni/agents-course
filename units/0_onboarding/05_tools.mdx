# Tools

This section will cover the tools you will need for the course. 

## What tools do I need? [[tools]]

You need only 3 things:

- *A computer* with an internet connection.
- A *Hugging Face Account*: to push and load models. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one **[here](https://hf.co/join)** (it's free).

After all this information, it's time to get started. We're going to do two things:

1. **Create your Hugging Face account** if it's not already done
2. **Sign up to Discord and introduce yourself** (don't be shy ü§ó)

### Let's create my Hugging Face account

(If it's not already done) create an account to HF <a href="https://huggingface.co/join">here</a>

### Let's join our Discord server

You can now sign up for our Discord Server. This is the place where you **can chat with the community and with us, create and join study groups to grow with each other and more**

üëâüèª Join our discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/UrrTSsSyjb">here.</a>

When you join, remember to introduce yourself in #introduce-yourself and sign-up for AI Agents channels in #channels-and-roles.

We have multiple AI Agents-related channels:
- `agents-course`: where we give the latest information about the course.
- `smolagents`: where you can discuss and get support with the library.

If this is your first time using Discord, we wrote a Discord 101 to get the best practices. Check the next section.

Congratulations! **You've just finished the on-boarding**. You're now ready to start to learn about AI Agents. Have fun!

### Keep Learning, stay awesome ü§ó
