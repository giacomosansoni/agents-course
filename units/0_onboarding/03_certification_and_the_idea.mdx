You can choose to follow this course either:

- *To get a certificate of completion*: you need to complete 1 of the use case assignments and 1 of the challenges. 
- *To get a certificate of honors*: you need to complete 100% of the assignments and 1 of the challenges.
- *As a simple audit*: you can participate in all challenges and do assignments if you want.

There's **no deadlines, the course is self-paced**.
Both paths **are completely free**.
Whatever path you choose, we advise you **to follow the recommended pace to enjoy the course and challenges with your fellow classmates.**

<!-- TODO: Validate grading for assignments -->
You don't need to tell us which path you choose. **If you get more than 80% of the assignments done, you'll get a certificate.**

## The Certification Process [[certification-process]]

The certification process is **completely free**:
<!-- TODO: Validate grading for assignments -->
- *To get a certificate of completion*: you need to complete 80% of the assignments.
- *To get a certificate of honors*: you need to complete 100% of the assignments.

Again, there's **no deadline** since the course is self paced. But our advice **is to follow the recommended pace section**.
