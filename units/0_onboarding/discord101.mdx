# Discord 101 [[discord-101]]

Hey there! My name is Huggy, the dog üêï, and I'm looking forward to train with you during this AI Agents Course!
Although I don't know much about fetching sticks (yet), I know one or two things about Discord. So I wrote this guide to help you learn about it!

Discord is a free chat platform. If you've used Slack, **it's quite similar**. 
<!-- TODO: Verify Discord invite link -->
There is a Hugging Face Community Discord server with 50000 members you can <a href="https://discord.gg/ydHrjt3WP5">join with a single click here</a>. So many humans to play with!

Starting in Discord can be a bit intimidating, so let me take you through it.

<!-- TODO: Verify Discord sign-up link -->
When you [sign-up to our Discord server](http://hf.co/join/discord), you'll choose your interests. Make sure to **click "AI Agents,"** and you'll get access to the AI Agents Category containing all the course-related channels. If you feel like joining even more channels, go for it! üöÄ

Then click next, you'll then get to **introduce yourself in the `#introduce-yourself` channel**.

They are in the AI Agents category. **Don't forget to sign up to these channels** by clicking on ü§ñ AI Agents in `role-assignment`.
- `agents-course`: where we give the **latest information about the course**.
- `smolagents`: where you can **discuss and get support with the library**.

The HF Community Server has a thriving community of human beings interested in many areas, so you can also learn from those. There are paper discussions, events, and many other things.

Was this useful? There are a couple of tips I can share with you:

- There are **voice channels** you can use as well, although most people prefer text chat.
- You can **use markdown style** for text chats. So if you're writing code, you can use that style. Sadly this does not work as well for links.
- You can open threads as well! It's a good idea when **it's a long conversation**.

I hope this is useful! And if you have questions, just ask!

See you later!

Huggy üê∂
