## What does the course look like? [[course-look-like]]

The course is composed of:

- *A fundamental part*: where you learn a **concept in theory**.
- *A hands-on*: where you'll learn **to use established AI Agent libraries** to train your agents in unique environments. These hands-on will be **Hugging Face spaces** witha pre-configured environment!
- *Use case assignments*: where you'll apply the concepts you've learned to solve a real-world problem.
- *The Challenge*: you'll get to put your agent to compete against other agents in a challenge. There will also be [a leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/AI-Agents-Leaderboard) for you to compare the agents' performance.

<img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/unit0/two-paths.jpg" alt="Two paths" width="100%"/>

You can choose to follow this course either:

- *To get a certificate of completion*: you need to complete 1 of the use case assignments and 1 of the challenges. 
- *To get a certificate of honors*: you need to complete 100% of the assignments and 1 of the challenges.
- *As a simple audit*: you can participate in all challenges and do assignments if you want.

There's **no deadlines, the course is self-paced**.
Both paths **are completely free**.
Whatever path you choose, we advise you **to follow the recommended pace to enjoy the course and challenges with your fellow classmates.**

You don't need to tell us which path you choose. **If you get more than 80% of the assignments done, you'll get a certificate.**

## The Certification Process [[certification-process]]

The certification process is **completely free**:

- *To get a certificate of completion*: you need to complete 80% of the assignments.
- *To get a certificate of honors*: you need to complete 100% of the assignments.

Again, there's **no deadline** since the course is self paced. But our advice **is to follow the recommended pace section**.
