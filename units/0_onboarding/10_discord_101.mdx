Join the Hugging Face Community Discord server, which has over 50,000 members, by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/ydHrjt3WP5). It's a great place to connect with others!

Starting on Discord can be a bit overwhelming, so here's a quick guide to help you navigate.

When you [sign up for our Discord server](http://hf.co/join/discord), you'll be prompted to choose your interests. Be sure to select **"AI Agents"** to gain access to the AI Agents Category, which includes all the course-related channels. Feel free to explore and join additional channels if you wish! ðŸš€

After signing up, introduce yourself in the `#introduce-yourself` channel.

In the AI Agents category, make sure to sign up for these channels by clicking on ðŸ¤– AI Agents in `role-assignment`:
- `agents-course`: for the **latest course information**.
- `smolagents`: for **discussion and support with the library**.

The HF Community Server hosts a vibrant community with interests in various areas, offering opportunities for learning through paper discussions, events, and more.

Here are a few tips for using Discord effectively:

- **Voice channels** are available, though text chat is more commonly used.
- You can format text using **markdown style**, which is especially useful for writing code. Note that markdown doesn't work as well for links.
- Consider opening threads for **long conversations** to keep discussions organized.

We hope you find this guide helpful! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
