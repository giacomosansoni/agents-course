# Onboarding: Your First Steps ⛵

Now that you have all the details, let's get started! We're going to do two things:

1. **Create your Hugging Face Account** if it's not already done
2. **Sign up to Discord and introduce yourself** (don't be shy 🤗)

### Step 1: Create Your Hugging Face Account

(If you haven’t already) create a Hugging Face account <a href='https://huggingface.co/join'>here</a>.

### Step 2: Join Our Discord Community

You can now sign up for our Discord Server. This is where you can** chat with the community (including us!)**, join study groups, and grow together.

👉🏻 Join our discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/UrrTSsSyjb">here.</a>

When you join, remember to introduce yourself in #introduce-yourself and sign-up for AI Agents channels in #channels-and-roles.

We have multiple AI Agents-related channels:
- `agents-course`: where we give the latest information about the course.
- `smolagents`: where you can discuss and get support with the library.

<!-- Study groups? -->

If this is your first time using Discord, we wrote a Discord 101 to get the best practices. Check the next section.

Congratulations! 🎉 **You've completed the onboarding process**! You're now ready to start learning about AI Agents. Have fun!

Keep Learning, stay awesome 🤗
