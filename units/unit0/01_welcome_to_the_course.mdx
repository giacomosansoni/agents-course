Welcome to the most exciting topic in AI today **Agents**!

This free course will take you on a journey, **from beginner to expert**, in understanding and building AI agents.

This first unit will help you to onboard, you'll:

- Discover the **course's syllabus**.
- **Choose the path** you're going to take (either self-audit or certification process).
- ** Get more information about the certification process and the deadlines**.
- Get to know the team behind the course.
- Create your **Hugging Face account**.
- **Sign-up to our Discord server**, and meet your classmates and us.

Let's get started!

## What to expect from this course? [[expect]]

In this course, you will:

- üìñ Study AI Agents in **theory, design, and practice.**
- üßë‚Äçüíª Learn to **use established AI Agent libraries** such as [smolagents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/en/index), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), and [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/).
- üíæ **Share your agents** on the Hugging Face Hub and explore agents created by the community.
- üèÜ Participate in challenges where you will **evaluate your agents against other students.**
- üéì **Earn a certificate of completion** by completing assignments.

And more!

A the end of this course you'll understand **how the Agents work and how to build your own Agents using the latest librairies and tools**.

## What does the course look like? [[course-look-like]]

The course is composed of:

- *Foundational Units*: where you learn Agents **concepts in theory**.
- *Hands-on*: where you'll learn **to use established AI Agent libraries** to train your agents in unique environments. These hands-on will be **Hugging Face spaces** with a pre-configured environment!
- *Use case assignments*: where you'll apply the concepts you've learned to solve a real-world problem that you'll choose.
- *The Challenge*: you'll get to put your agent to compete against other agents in a challenge. There will also be [a leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/AI-Agents-Leaderboard) for you to compare the agents' performance.

This course is a living project, evolving with your feedback and contributions from the community.

Here is the general syllabus for the course. With each unit a more detailed list of topics will be released. 

| Chapter | Topic | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 0 | Onboarding | Set you up with the tools and platforms that you will use. |
| 1 | Agent Fundamentals | Explain Tools, Thoughts, Actions, Observations, and their formats. Explain LLMs, messages, special tokens and chat-template. Show a simple use case in generic python functions. |
| 2 | Frameworks | Understand how the fundamentals are implemented in popular libraries : smolAgents, LangGraph, LLamaIndex |
| 3 | Use Cases | Let's build some real life use cases ( open to PRs ü§ó from experienced Agent builders ) |
| 4 | Final Assignment | Build an agent for a selected benchmark and prove your understanding of Agents on the student leaderboard  üöÄ |

*Over the coming weeks further bonus units will be released.*


## The Certification Process [[certification-process]]
