- *Use case assignments*: where you'll apply the concepts you've learned to solve a real-world problem that you'll choose.
- *The Challenge*: you'll get to put your agent to compete against other agents in a challenge. There will also be [a leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/AI-Agents-Leaderboard) for you to compare the agents' performance.
